# 📌 ML_Git_Lab – Version Control in Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Git Version Control** in a Machine Learning workflow.

The objective is to:

* Track ML code changes
* Experiment using branches
* Merge model variations
* Push project to a remote GitHub repository

---

## 👥 Project Scenario

Team-based ML development:

* Member A → Data Preprocessing
* Member B → Feature Engineering
* Member C → Model Training

This repository simulates collaborative ML development using Git.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression

* Basic regression model
* Trained on dataset
* Evaluated using R² Score

### 2️⃣ Linear Regression with Feature Scaling

* Added `StandardScaler`
* Improved preprocessing pipeline

### 3️⃣ Decision Tree Regressor (Experimental Branch)

* Implemented in separate branch
* Merged into main branch
